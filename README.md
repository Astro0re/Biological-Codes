# Biological Codes 
Codes to automate certain biological processes with accurate results  

## DNA Sequencing
To confirm the validity of strings of DNA sequences, as well as counting of the sequence compoents;
[Code](DNA_Sequence.py) or [Code](DNA_Sequence.r)

## Punnet Squares 
To display all possible combinations of parent genotype across resulting generations;
[Code](Punnett%20Squares.py)

## Sequence Alignment 
To perform sequence alignment on two genes/proteins to confirm Homogeneity;
[Code](Sequence%20Alignment.py)

## Relational Skeletal Database 
Relational Skeletal System Data Base system to test students about their knowledge of the skeletal system, the articulations and so on;
[Code]()

## Genotype Identification
AI classification model for Red blood cells, to be used for anaomaly scan to identify diseases affecting the oxygen carrying cell that is erythrocytes; [Code](Genotype%20Identification.py) [Code_2](Genotype_Identifier.ipynb)

## Phylogenetic Tree Distance Claculator
Code to determine the evolutionary distance between a set of DNA sequences using a set of formuls; [Code](Phylogenetic%20tree.py)
